data_structures
===============

Some of those classics Data Structures eg: Hash Tables, Trees, Queues &amp; Stacks and so on. All code is built using C++ language.

### Hash Tables

Here both versions of a Hash Table is implemented. The Open Hash Table is implemented with an underlying array with a parameter that means the fill factor in such way controling how often occurs collisions. The other implementation is a normal hash where each entry corresponds a list of objects to be stored.
